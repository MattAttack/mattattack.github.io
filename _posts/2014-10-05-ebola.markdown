+ Experimenting with [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/).
+ Data can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola/blob/master/country_timeseries.json).

This is a visualization of the counts of Ebola deaths and cases in 5 countries from 3/22/2014 - 9/28/2014. You can watch the counts slowly grow and then take off around day 150. I hope to find more data and build out a more detailed visualization (perhaps with a map?).
