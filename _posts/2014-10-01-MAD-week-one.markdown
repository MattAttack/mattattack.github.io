Last week (09/22/2014) was the first week of [MAD](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mad/)'s weekly sessions. MAD is a learning-based Computer Science organization at [UT Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/) that teaches 5 weekly 1-2 hour sessions: Beginner and Advanced iOS, Beginner and Advanced Android and Beginner Web. I am teaching the web development sessions and at every session this week we had the attendees all sign in to collect information on our audience. This post serves to be a high level of MAD's first week.

Breakdown of Members
--------------------
Over 5 different sessions 164 attendees signed in. Breaking this down further, 124 of these individuals were unique and many students attended multiple sessions (!!!). Their are 2,137 undergraduate students in the Computer Science Department, meaning MAD directly engaged with 5.8% of the undergraduate population this week. Let's break this down even further.

### By Gender
The following is a breakdown of these unique members by gender:

To give an idea of MAD's student pipeline, the UTCS undergraduate population is 17.83% female.

### By Year

Breakdown of Sessions
---------------------

Android was our most popular topic by far! 44.5% of attendees were Android attendees. During some of the Android sessions students had to sit on the floor due to lack of seating.

Now let's combine some of these metrics. Here is a breakdown of each session by gender.

In Conclusion
-------------
Overall it was one hell of a week for MAD. It's awesome to see 100+ students give up there weekday evenings to come learn. While certain areas could be improved, we are leaps and bounds ahead of where we were last year.
