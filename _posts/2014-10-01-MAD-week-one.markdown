Last week (09/22/2014) was the first week of [MAD](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mad/)'s weekly sessions. MAD is a learning-based Computer Science organization at [UT Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/) that teaches 5 weekly 1-2 hour sessions: Beginner and Advanced iOS, Beginner and Advanced Android and Beginner Web. I am teaching the web development sessions and at every session this week we had the attendees all sign in to collect information on our audience.

This post serves as a summary of week one and me playing around with chart.js

At a high level:

+ total attendence amongst all 5 sessions was 164
+ unique attendence throughout the week was 124
+ TODO: Add more from a high level

Breakdown of Members
--------------------
Over the course of the 5 different sessions 164 attendees signed in. Breaking this down further, 124 of these individuals were unqiue and many students attended multiple sessions throughout the week (!!!).

### By Gender
The following is a breakdown of these unique members by gender:

### By Year
The following is a breakdown of these unique members by year:

The percentage of females attending sessions is 16.1%. This is right inline with the industry average of 17%.

In Conclusion
-------------
Overall it was one hell of a week for MAD. While not where we would like to be, we are leaps and bounds ahead of where we were last year and continuing to push to be an inclusive and welcoming learning environment.

Additional Notes

+ This post does not include any data from MAD's first hack night which was thrown this past Friday (9/26). 66 students gave up there Friday night to come spend time on projects of their choosing for ~5 hours. Shout out to Jay Aisenbrey for winning the hack night with his awesome [OU to OU-Sucks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ou-to-ou-sucks/njomcdgkmfnboapalebljapdaocjhbnc) Chrome extension.
+ MAD is actively looking for companies to partner with. Supporters of MAD have access to some of the top talent at UT through our weekly sessions, hack nights, and uMAD (our annual developers conference). For more information, shoot me an [email](mailto:mattebeweber@utexas.edu).
