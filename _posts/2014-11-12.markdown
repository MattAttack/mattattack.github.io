I believe it's important to reflect on successes and failures over time. This is just a list of different things. When I have a rough time or am facing something, I look back at this list and remember how awful I thought it was at the time.

+ 2013: After 3 interviewers with Khan Academy, my number one choice for my junior internship I am rejected after interviewing with someone working full time at Khan Academy a year younger than me.
+ 2014: After onsite Google APM interviews, I am called and rejected.
